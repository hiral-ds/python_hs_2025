> JavaScript Basics: Variables
- In JavaScript, variables are used to store data that can be used and modified later.
- Step 1: Declare a variable:-var firstname;
- Step 2: Assign it some information: firstname = "Hiral Shewale";
- Step 3: Use it:- console.log(firstname); // Output: Hiral Shewale
- Step 4: Change it:-
firstname = "Hiri";
console.log(firstname); // Output: Hiri
- JavaScript is case sensitive. It is good practice to use "use strict"; at the beginning of your code to catch common coding mistakes and prevent certain issues.
