## string

>Definition
- In JavaScript, a string is a data type representing a sequence of characters that may consist of letters, numbers, symbols, words, or sentences.

- You can access each character inside a string through its numeric index – starting from zero – using bracket notation:
- let str = 'larch';
- str[0]; // 'l'
- str[1]; // 'a'
- str[2]; // 'r'
- str[3]; // 'c'
- str[4]; // 'h'
